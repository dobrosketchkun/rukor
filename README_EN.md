This repository contains continuing experiments with Russian scripts such as [rulat](https://github.com/dobrosketchkun/rulatwiki) and [abominoto sans](https://github.com/dobrosketchkun/Abominoto-Sans). The inspiration was the video [How Korea's alphabet is saving an Indonesian dialect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dtTBDEXVYY).

The transcription of the Russian language using Hangul:

![alt text](table.jpg "Title")

I tried to make the matches as logical as possible, but some solutions were made up from thin air, which, however, is not too surprising in this case, the missing letters had to be taken from somewhere.

### Example:

```Алисе надоело сидеть на пригорке рядом с сестрой и ничего не делать.```

```아리세 나도여로 시데테 나 ㅍ러이고러케 러야돔 ㅅ 솃ㅌ러오여 이 니쳬고 녜 뎨로테.```

Another spelling variant:

```아릿예 낟오예로 싣예테 나 ㅍ러이고러켸 러야돔 ㅅ 솃ㅌ러오여 이 닟예고 녜 뎰아테.```

It can be obtained using the script [rukor.py](https://github.com/dobrosketchkun/rukor/blob/main/rukor.py)
